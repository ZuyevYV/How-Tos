# How-Tos for www.sap.com
Welcome to the Markdown How-To repository for How-To documents on the [SAP developer pages](http://www.sap.com/developer.html).


# How to contribute
Contributions from external authors may be accepted in the future. However, for now you can provide us with feedback (e.g. outdated screens) and suggestions for improvements on existing tutorials by creating a Github issue.

We have a large How-To pipeline in the works, but in case you have something in mind right away, please [create a new How-To issue](https://github.com/SAPDocuments/How-Tos/issues/new) with the Label `enhancement` and let us know what you'd like to see covered in a tutorial.

Every contributor needs to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) provided by SAP. To make this step hassle-free, this repository has activated the [CLA assistant](https://cla-assistant.io).
